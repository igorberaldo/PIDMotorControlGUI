# PIDMotorControlGUI
User Interface that enables the user to choose which controller and input type to apply for the system, such as P, PI and PID, it also enables the user to choose between speed and position to be controlled and show the data collected by the microcontroller on a chart, where the user can analyse and play to understand how these controllers works.
This UI is designed to control the project on this repository https://github.com/igorberaldo/PIDMotorControl
